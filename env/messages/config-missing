[red] Error!
Configuration files are missing!

The environment requires following configuration files:
config/project.json
package.json

Optionally:
config/local.json - for local development.

And in case of WordPress project:
.env
composer.json

Some of them are missing. Try running "node setup" - it should
generate all missing files for you!
